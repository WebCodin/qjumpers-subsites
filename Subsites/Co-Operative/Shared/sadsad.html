<p>Automated global search and match software...and more – headhunting done!</p>
</div>
<p>At QJumpers, we understand the pressure of working in a time sensitive and competitive recruitment environment, where you need to identify the best talent fast and recruit even faster.</p>
<p>Top talent is in high demand. You need technology to help find talent quickly and then to easily identify the stars. Our Global Search and Match functionality automatically scours publicly available data, such as networking sites, social media, company websites and blogs, to identify candidates for your job. Criteria, such as credentials, location, skills, education and experience, can be prioritized, producing a ranked list of potential candidates. With one click, top candidates can be added to your talent pool or invited to apply for your job, bypassing the need for outside recruiters and head-hunters.</p>
<p>Advertise your jobs on as many job sites and social media platforms as you like with just a click. Invite suitably matched candidates in your talent pool to apply or simply call them to get a jump start to your recruitment process. Your ATS will automatically rank incoming applicants based on criteria that you have set.</p>
<p>Our software automatically acknowledges all applicants so that you don’t need to. Screening questionnaires automatically filter unsuitable applicants. Send templated emails to many applicants at the same time. Copy jobs, withdraw jobs, edit jobs…. the list goes on. Let’s just say that our software is designed to eliminate all the time-consuming tasks and makes finding top staff easy!</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the applicant experience. If you have a long difficult application process, top talent just won’t apply. Applicants will love your quick QJumpers application process – just upload a resume and our system will automatically create their profile. Or if they already have a profile, it’s even faster! Job done.</p>

<p class="space10">Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to hire</li>
<li>Number of applicants</li>
<li>Number of applicants shortlisted, interviewed, hired</li>
<li>Where the applicants came from</li>
<li>Where the best applicants came from</li>

<li>How many roles per Business Unit per month?</li>
<li>How many active roles?</li>
<li>How many filled roles?</li>
</ul>
<p class="space10">The list goes on. You can use them as they are in pdf and show your boss what a good job you're doing - or export them to excel and manipulate the data how you want. Go ahead – it’s your data.</p>
<p>Benchmark your organization and make your recruitment process more efficient with the help of the QJumpers reporting module.</p>

<div class="key-feature">Align and automate workflows to suit your business</div>
<p class="space10">Every candidate is different. So is every company. Why use a recruitment system that isn’t flexible?</p>
<p class="space10">QJumpers lets you control users’ functionality and viewing rights to suit your recruitment workflows. Delegate jobs and set permission levels to fit in with the way you recruit. Give view-only rights, remove communication functionality, allow users to shortlist but not notify, include permissions to make offers and override original approvals – it’s up to you.</p>
<p class="space10">Our Job Requisition module is ridiculously simple to create and to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add as many different workflows as you like with fixed or stepped approvers.</li>
<li>Email alerts keep the process flowing.</li>
<li>See at a glance whose approval is next and give over-ride power to a super-user.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no extra charges for adding more users. So go ahead, share the workload and let the right people choose the right people. Automate workflows, delegate decision making, improve transparency and communication, and save everyone time. Try not to spend it all at once.</p>

<p class="space10">Applicants are searching and applying for jobs on their phones, hiring managers are managing applicants at airports and between meetings – wherever they can on whatever device they have. So why does it have to be so hard? Well..... it doesn’t.</p>
<h4 class="space20">Convenient</h4>
<p class="space10">QJumpers recruitment software enables users on any device to apply, access cloud storage, manage applicants, load jobs, approve a job requisition, shortlist, decline, arrange an interview, approve a package, generate a report ... you name it. It’s all there.</p>
<p class="space10">We’ll even send you emails from time to time, to remind you of unfinished tasks - and then give you a link to do it right there. Old school we know; but if it works for you, it works for us.</p>
<h4 class="space20">Faster</h4>
<p class="space10">Recruitment software is meant to speed up the recruitment process and make your life easier. If you have to wait until you're back at your office to manage a job, your process is taking too long. At QJumpers, we’re all about helping you get to the best applicants – fast, and from anywhere. Never miss out on your dream applicant again.</p>

<div class="key-feature">Recruit faster with software that makes sense</div>
<p class="space10">Intuition can be a big factor in hiring the right candidate. It’s no less important in designing the right recruitment software. If you want a system that’s easy for everyone to use, good news: QJumpers is here.</p>
<h4 class="space20">Simplified</h4>
<p class="space10">If a user doesn’t have permission for certain functionality – we take the buttons away. If they don’t have viewing rights for certain Business Units, jobs or applicants – we hide them. When candidates apply for jobs, we automatically populate their profile from their resume to make it fast and easy for them. With simple implementation, flexible system integration, a streamlined interface and intuitive functionality, your team will be able to manage their part of the recruitment process without even reading the instructions. It just makes sense.</p>
<h4 class="space20">Specialized</h4>
<p class="space10">Unlike other recruitment systems, QJumpers isn’t a CRM, Human Resource or payroll system trying to handle recruitment. QJumpers is built by recruiters for recruiting – pure and simple. Gone are the days of searching for hours to find a candidate, just to remember what role they applied for.</p>
<h4 class="space20">Utilized</h4>
<p>The result is a system that’s loved by recruiters and hiring managers of all industries: from farmers, grape growers and mechanics, to car dealers, port workers, sales managers, accountants, IT managers and more. And pretty soon, your team will love QJumpers too.</p>

<p>Highly skilled candidates are also highly in demand. To be successful at the hiring game, you need to identify the best quickly and make contact immediately.</p>
<p>The talent pool is FREE with QJumpers because we see it as an integral part of any overall talent strategy. Job boards can no longer be relied upon to bring you the best talent. Staffing agencies are expensive. The QJumpers’ talent pool helps you to develop – and stay in touch with – your own database of potential employees. When the right role comes along, simple filtering, tags and keyword search functionality helps you identify the best people and invite them for the role. Shortly, we’ll automate this process too!</p>
<p>Automatically tag applicants based on answers to your application forms or on the jobs they are applying for. Add tags, remove tags, maintain tags. You have the control to manage your talent pool in the way that suits your organization’s recruitment needs.</p>
<p>Notes within the talent pool provide you with an audit trail of each candidate for their entire history of contact with your organization. You can see who shortlisted them and when, which jobs they’ve applied for, the status of each application and every email that’s been generated.</p>

<p>Our team is full of real people, ready to help and answer your questions – no matter how silly you think they are. We offer online assistance, a support email address, online user manuals and a knowledge center. We also have phone support for 18 hours a day - thanks to our New Zealand colleagues down under. But honestly, with a recruitment system this easy, you might never use them.</p>
<p>We can talk techy if that’s what you like, or we can keep it simple. No matter the language, we’ll help you get your jobs posted, applicants hired and reassure you that the world won’t fall apart if you click that button.</p>
<p>You can see our happy faces on this page, or we can pay you a visit if you’d like! The more we know about you and how you recruit, the easier we can help you get what you need.</p>
<p>Oh – did we mention that we don’t charge for support? And that there is actually a human on the end of the phone? And if you come on board with us, you’ll have your own Account Manager to help you with the setup – but you probably won’t need them.</p>

Our software ensures all of your data is seamlessly added to whatever other HR systems you're using, automatically, so that you don’t have to.</p>
<p class="&quot;space10">We integrate with job boards, social media platforms, assessment providers and background checks. Your jobs integrate automatically into your careers site. Emails and interview appointments sent using QJumpers can also feed into your email system. <br /> If we don’t integrate with it directly, our APIs will cover the rest.</p>
<p>If you want a collaborative (decentralized) recruitment process, a big, lumbering Human Resource Information System (HRIS) won’t cut it, with overcomplicated functionality confusing hiring managers and creating pushback.</p>
<p>Don’t settle for anything less than a best in breed recruitment software system (ATS) like QJumpers. Your team will thank you for it.</p>

<h4 class="space20">Modules</h4>
<div class="key-feature">The nice thing about the QJumpers monthly plans is that we include most modules in your recruitment software solution right out of the gate. No special requests or add-ons required.</div>
<p>There are several functions we believe are essential in a world-class applicant tracking system. Every QJumpers plan comes standard with access to reporting and analytics, resumé parsing, a talent pool linked to your system, automated screening and candidate ranking and job board integration. You can use our APIs to integrate with your other HR systems and automatically load jobs to your careers site, and you can even customize your workflows. On top of all that (we know, it’s a lot), you can choose to add the following modules depending on your needs:</p>
<h4>Job Requisition:</h4>
<p>Take away the cumbersome steps of a manual job requisition process, gain better transparency of where each requisition is at and automate the approval chain.</p>
<p>Job Requisition creates structured requisition approval processes within your recruitment system to match your organizational needs. Workflows can be highly customized, to suit basic or complex requirements, and are easy to maintain internally.</p>
<p class="space10">Approved users are able to provide approval on-behalf of others if needed. Job notes record every action and decision to provide transparency of who has done what and when. A simple requisition dashboard shows you who the process is waiting on and how far through it is. Dashboard alerts and emails notify users of any approvals that are required of them. Users without access to your QJumpers recruitment system can still approve a job requisition through secure emails. And finally, all information captured in the job requisition process is automatically fed into the job load process to save you even more time.</p>
<h4>Free Instant Jobs Site:</h4>
<p>All licensed system administrators can quickly and easily create their company job vacancies page with their logo and color scheme. Once created, all job vacancies will automatically be posted to this website for applicants to browse, apply and register their interest to work with your organization.</p>
<p>The jobs site is fully mobile optimized to make it very fast and simple for job seekers to apply from any mobile device. Candidates can also login to maintain their profile, view previous applications and ‘fast apply’ using their saved profile.</p>
<h4><span> Other Modules</span>:</h4>
<p>From within the administration area, the company administrator can create templated emails, customize compensation items for offers, customize reasons for declining an applicant, create and assign organization questionnaires and customize hierarchies and role permissions.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on this section as we are adding new functionality all the time! And if there is something you want that is not there, login to your QJumpers help area and request a new feature.</p>
